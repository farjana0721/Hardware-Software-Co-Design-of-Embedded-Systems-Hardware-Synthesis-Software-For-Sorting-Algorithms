# Hardware-Software-Co-Design-of-Embedded-Systems

**In computer science, we have come across multiple
array-sorting algorithms which help us to organize elements in
specific orders. There are many ways to implement them, i.e. with
programming languages like C, C++, or java, we can implement
them on software. We can also implement them on hardware
using VHDL. This report discusses 3 different array sorting
algorithms and the opportunities of implementing them both in
software and hardware.**

**Three Sorting algorithms we choose are:**
-Insertion Sort
-Bubble Sort
-Radix Sort

 **Algorithmic State Machine with Datapath (ASMD) and Finite State Machines with Datapath (FSMD) of these thre algorithms are following:

 - Insertion Sort:
